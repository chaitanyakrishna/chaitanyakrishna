# Hi, I’m Chaitanya 👋

I work in cybersecurity, focusing on **incident response, threat intelligence, and security automation**.

I currently work at **Microsoft**, where I’m part of a global team handling **large-scale security incidents and containment across first-party infrastructure**. Most of my day-to-day work is about understanding attacker behavior, reducing response time, and building automation that helps teams move faster during incidents.



## What I work on

- Investigating and responding to security incidents at enterprise scale  
- Threat actor containment and remediation  
- Turning threat intelligence into detections and response actions  
- Building automation and SOAR workflows to reduce manual response  
- Improving SOC processes through use cases, playbooks, and tooling  

I enjoy work that blends **security engineering and operations**, especially where reliability and clarity matter more than tooling.



## Open-source projects

I build tools when something feels repetitive, slow, or error-prone.

### 🔹 IOC Scraper  
Automates extraction and normalization of indicators of compromise from blogs, PDFs, CSVs, and reports.

- Supports IPs, domains, URLs, hashes, YARA rules, and MITRE ATT&CK IDs  
- Defanging and basic whitelisting included  
- Designed to fit into real threat-intelligence workflows

### 🔹 Threat Feed Automator  
Collects domains and IP addresses from multiple threat feeds for enrichment and analysis.

### 🔹 Subdomain Enumerator  
Lightweight script for enumerating subdomains using the SecurityTrails API.

### 🔹 Ginger-Chai  
Helps identify static and dynamic pages in web applications to assist with assessment scoping.

## Technical areas I spend time in

- Incident response & threat containment  
- Cyber threat intelligence (strategic, operational, tactical)  
- SOAR & security automation (Python, PowerShell)  
- Detection engineering & MITRE ATT&CK mapping  
- Cloud security (Azure, AWS, GCP)  
- SIEM, EDR, and telemetry-driven investigations  

I care more about **how systems fail under pressure** than perfect architectures.



## Teaching & sharing

- Created a beginner-friendly **Penetration Testing with Metasploit** course  
- Delivered talks and internal sessions on offensive and defensive security topics  
- Built hands-on virtual labs for realistic security training  

Teaching forces clarity — and security needs more of that.
